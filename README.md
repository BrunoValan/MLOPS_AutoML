# AutoML using Azure's Machine Learning Studio
This is a repository for my second project in my course AIPI 561 - MLOps. The goal of this unit was to familiarize ourselves and begin to use some of the AutoML tools. 
For my project I decided to work with Azure's Machine Learning Studio. This repo will be relatively simple as Machine Learning Studio is a low code/no code AutoML solution. 
The instructions for running the project are here in the read me and the data set that I used (a kaggle data set that uses medical information to predict heart disease is in the 
data directory.
